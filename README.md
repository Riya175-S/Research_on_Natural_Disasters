India receives its rainfall primarily from the Southwest monsoon winds during June to September. The rainfall varies significantly across different regions due to geographic features and other factors.
Western Coast and Western Ghats: States like Kerala, coastal Karnataka, and Goa typically receive heavy rainfall due to the orographic effect of the Western Ghats.
North-Eastern States: States like Meghalaya, Assam, Nagaland, and others in the region also receive substantial rainfall due to their proximity to the Bay of Bengal. The town of Mawsynram in Meghalaya is known to be one of the wettest places on earth.

Himalayan States: The Indian Himalayan region, including Jammu & Kashmir, Himachal Pradesh, Uttarakhand, and Arunachal Pradesh, receives significant rainfall, particularly during the monsoon season.
Rainfall is crucial for agriculture and water supply in India. However, excessive or untimely rainfall can lead to a variety of problems and destructions. Here are some of the main issues:
Floods: India frequently experiences severe flooding, especially in the monsoon season. States such as Assam, Bihar, Uttar Pradesh, and West Bengal are often severely affected. Floods can result in loss of life, displacement of people, damage to crops, and destruction of infrastructure.
Landslides: Heavy rainfall can cause landslides, especially in hilly and mountainous regions such as the Western Ghats and the Himalayas. Landslides can lead to massive destruction, including loss of life and property, road blockages, and isolation of regions.
Urban Infrastructure Collapse: In many urban areas, heavy rainfall can overwhelm drainage systems, leading to waterlogging and disruptions in traffic. This often exposes inadequate urban planning and infrastructure.
